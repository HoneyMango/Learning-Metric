## Primary School level Web-based learning tool for Mass in the metric system

Inside of the "Learning Metric" folder, the "*index.html*" is the starting point for this learning tool.


## About this project
This project was created with the intention of making learning the metric system a more fun experience for primary school children. By allowing the students to interact with the learning tool on the computer it would help to keep them interested and allow them to learn in an environment which they are familiar with and enjoy. 

I chose the metric system after some teachers expressed their concerns about sutdents struggling with the topic.

## Some things to be added
* Sections for **Capacity** and **Measurement**
* Separating content into class levels 
* Increasing the number of questions (*The current number of questions was chosen to quickly showcase the tool to teachers*)
* Adding more interactivity and making more appealing the exercise section of the tool

*Less Pressing*
* Sound to engage the children more and to give positive feedback
